However, you can also add figures directly by editing the `layout.md` file.  If you add a line to the layout file, with an appropriate extension, e.g.

    file.png
    
it will add a figure, but that figure will _not_ have an associated caption.

In order to create a figure with a caption, you need some directory structure:

    figure1/file.png
    figure1/caption.tex
    figure1/size.tex
